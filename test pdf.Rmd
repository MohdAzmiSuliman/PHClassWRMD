## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Example - Mediation and confounder

Among important concept in disease causation is bias and confounding. Confounders can be due to a noncausal association between a given exposure and an outcome observed as a result of the influence of third variable


```{r}
grid.newpage()
exposure <-
  "Exposure
  (e.g. Coffee)"
expbox <- boxGrob(exposure, x=.2, y=.8)
outcome <-
  "Outcome
  (e.g. Lung Ca)"
outbox <- boxGrob(outcome, x=.8, y=.8)
confounder <-
  "Confounder
  (e.g. Smoking)"
confbox <- boxGrob(confounder, x=.5, y=.2)
connectGrob(expbox, outbox, "horizontal")
connectGrob(expbox, confbox, "vertical")
connectGrob(confbox, expbox, "vertical")
connectGrob(confbox, outbox, "vertical")

expbox
outbox
confbox
```
